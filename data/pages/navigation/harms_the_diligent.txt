====Harms, The Diligent: A Voyage Through the Worlds of the Slave Trade====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
I'm not entirely sure there //is// a question here. Perhaps it is something like: What did the Middle Passage look like? What global and cultural dynamics empowered and animated it? \\
Others have read this book as a beginning stage of globalization. I also think it's worth meditating on an argument that Harms seems to be making. He rejects the static concept of slave trade instead remarking that it "was a kaleidoscope of diverse national and local endeavors that was constantly changing over time."((xiv))\\
“So seductive was the lure of profits from the slave trade that it could transform economies, reshape moral sensitivities, refocus state policies, and influence the ride and fall of kingdoms.”((Harms, xix))\\
Per Geneva:
  * beginning of Atlantic turn
  * the African perspective
  * what you can do with a single source
\\
This story is the tale of a French slave ship setting sail in 1731 -- France comes late to the slave trade when its colonies in the Caribbean begin producing sugar
