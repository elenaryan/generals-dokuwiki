====Lewis, The Republican Wife: Virtue and Seduction in the Early Republic====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question:** How did the Revolution affect the woman's role?\\
“The argument here is that American republicanism offered women a role as wives. It was left to liberalism, as Kerber suggests, to extol the political dimensions of motherhood.”((Lewis, 690))\\

Lewis argues that because courtship and marriage became political through their analogy to the republic, they made women political beings.((Lewis, 698))\\

\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
Complicates the idea of the Republican Mother by pushing it to 1830 and the rise of a kind of Jacksonian individualism. Prior to that, however, republicanism made women political through marriage and their role of kind of... making men better.
