What was the experience of women in British colonial New England?<br/>

Ulrich answers that a woman was:<br/>

-	Housewife<br/>

-	Deputy husband<br/>

-	Consort<br/>

-	Mother<br/>

-	Mistress<br/>

-	Neighbor<br/>

-	Christian<br/>

-	Heroine<br/>

</p>

<p>
<br/>

Indeed, Ulrich insists that the story of women is “important not simply because it affected what we have come to know as the history of early New England but because it was an integral and essential part of that history.”<sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup><br/>
