<strong>Question: </strong>Why did Black women experience the carceral system and Jim Crow so distinctly?<br/>

It&#039;s closer to: How did the state create a gendered and racialized carceral system and why?<br/>

She is also highly concerned with Black women&#039;s resistance to that system.<br/>

“this book reveals how the criminal legal system crafted, reinforced, or required black female deviance as part of the broader constitution of Jim Crow modernity premised upon the devaluation and dehumanization of black life broadly.”<sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup><br/>

“the goal of this book is to demonstrate that gender is constructed by and through race and that the production of woman and other stable gender categories required violence”<sup><a href="#fn__2" id="fnt__2" class="fn_top">2)</a></sup>
 Haley also shows convincingly that the shifts in the carceral system are closely tied to the rise of capitalism.<br/>

<p>
Watershed law in 1908 provides judicial discretion for sentencing “reasserted the racial definition of femaleness and womanhood that had operated under convict leasing precisely because it did not specify that it was only applicable to white women” <sup><a href="#fn__3" id="fnt__3" class="fn_top">3)</a></sup>

Just as other scholars taught us that we cannot understand the history of white supremacy without studying lynching and rape, Sarah Haley shows us that female incarceration cannot be ignored either.
