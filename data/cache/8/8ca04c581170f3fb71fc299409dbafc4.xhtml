<strong>Question:</strong> Why and how did a brutal penal system develop in early America?<br/>

</p>

<p>
Manion&#039;s argument is that “leading jurists and progressive elites used the penal system to discipline and punish diverse citizens in ways that advanced social hierarchies rooted in race, gender, class, and sexual differences” and did so as they were attempting to make claims on the promises of the American Revolution.<sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
“The penitentiary made the systemic manipulation of individuals, the classification and assessment of difference, and the restriction of one’s life chances based on these differences seem both natural and neutral – a legacy with profoundly devastating consequences for American justice.”<sup><a href="#fn__2" id="fnt__2" class="fn_top">2)</a></sup>

One review says this study is valuable insofar as it synthesizes existing scholarship. I do think that Manion seems to do a good job demarcating the ways that early American elites grounded punishment and the reform system in language of sentimentality and republican idealism such that they made it seem natural.
