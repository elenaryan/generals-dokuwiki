=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
Despite the paucity of evidence, Hall's case presents a nonetheless
 richly detailed glimpse of an early modern community's responses to
 gender transgression, exposing to view a multiplicity of popular beliefs
 about sexual difference and the variety of uses to which they could be
 put by groups of people with different stakes in the social order.((Brown, 172))\\
\\
The case of Thomasine Hall forced ordinary people to articulate the essence of maleness and femaleness and then make that mean something real and important to the world around.\\
"Law, religion, and custom thus stabilized
 gender although they did so without access to a stable biological concept
 of sexual difference." ((Brown, 174))
