Godbeer is deeply intrigued by the development of sodomy laws and how it would have been prosecuted and punished. Indeed, he investigates sodomy as “a sexual category and a social issue.”<sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup><br/>

</p>

<p>
The crux of Godbeer&#039;s argument is really that we cannot anachronize sexuality or sex acts because indeed at this place and in this moment, “legal prosecution became possible only when the social disruption brought about by Sension’s advances seemed to outweigh his worth as a citizen.”<sup><a href="#fn__2" id="fnt__2" class="fn_top">2)</a></sup>

Godbeer’s 1995 article is, in his words, about “sodomy as a sexual category and as a social issue in colonial New England.” Specifically focusing on the case of Nicholas Sension in Windsor Connecticut in the 17th c, Godbeer uses what he calls “one man’s prolonged quest for sexual partners among his fellow townsmen” to argue that public opinion of sodomy was much more forgiving than the law – or even the colonial church. Using sermons and legal records, Godbeer concludes that New Englanders “either did not condemn sodomy as readily as their leaders or else took the view that acting against such behavior was less important than maintaining the social integrity and reputation of their communities.”
