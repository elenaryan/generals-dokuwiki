In Independence Lost, Kathleen DuVal asserts that, not only was the gulf coast fringe of the American Revolution extraordinarily consequential to the outcome of the American Revolution, but the stories of its residents illuminate a narrative seldom told: that of the loss of agency and independence for a significant portion of the population(xxiv, 347).

DuVal&#039;s central thrust is worked out in the quotidian irony that “independence depended on others” (293). For most actors in colonial America, indigenous or intrusive, she argues, “advantageous interdependence was a more logical goal,” and all employed tactics that would offer “more control over dependent relationships” (xxi).

DuVal is moving the frame of revolution to the gulf coast to show the intense contingency of the revolution.
