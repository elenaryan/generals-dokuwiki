====Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
Xxix Bailyn says that a fundamental and general ideology characterized and empowered the revolution (spurred and influenced by Enlightenment values).
\\
Put differently, Bailyn believes that there was a truly-held ideology behind the Revolution and that it can be traced in America well before the imperial system had become intractable in the 1760s and 70s. It can be traced to:
  * classical antiquity
  * enlightened rationalism
  * english common law
  * political and social theories of New England Puritanism
  * the radical political and social thought of the English Civil War and Commonwealth period

**Question:** Why did Americans declare independence? How did they justify the revolution and how did they articulate themselves.
\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
Wood characterizes this book as "the culmination of a long-existing tradition of interpreting the causes of the Revolution in terms of ideas rather than social conflict."

\\
In truth, Bailyn's book is essential reading on the American Revolution. He captures the powerful wave of American thought that led the colonies to discard imperial rule, meticulously tracing the discourse of the era through pamphlets.
\\
=== Sources and Methodology: === 
Famously, short form pamphlets published as responses to events as they happened, responses to local issues or "chain-reacting personal polemics," and ritualistic pamphlets like of orations.((Bailyn, 5))
\\
=== Critiques and Praise: === 
Perhaps Bailyn jettisons the progressive interpretation too much. Indeed he calls the eighteenth century the "age of ideology."((Bailyn, 158)) This corresponds to his argument that ideology rather than social conditions empowered the revolution.
