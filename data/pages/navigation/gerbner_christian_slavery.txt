====Gerbner, Christian Slavery: Conversion and Race in the Protestant Atlantic World====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question:** How did Christians reconcile their religion with slavery and how did slave conversion fit into that?\\
Periodization: “during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, however, it is more accurate to understand the conflict between missionaries and slave owners as a clash between Protestant Supremacy which excluded enslaved people from Christianity, and Christian Slavery, which sought to include slaves within the Protestant community.”((Gerbner, 3))\\

Gerbner suggests that as Christian slavery began to prevail -- a Christianity made accessible to enslaved people -- white supremacy also emerged to take the place of Protestant Supremacy to better allow white people to constrain Black people. One example of this is in the 1697 law in Barbados that added "white" to the voting qualifications alongside male, Christian, and landowning.\\

She also changes the narrative that Quakers and the like were monolithic originators of antislavery sentiment.
