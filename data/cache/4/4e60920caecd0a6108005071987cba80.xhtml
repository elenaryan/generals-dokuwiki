<strong>Question:</strong> How and why did American unity emerge in the early republic?
<br/>

Popular celebration in the early republic absorbed the common folk in a rite of common assent that makes local acts relevant on a national stage and both allowed and built the Early Republic. These rituals policed virtue while offering a theater for the people to spectate on high politics as well as participate in those same politics. Waldsy argues that “relentless politicization gave nationalist rituals their most important meanings. Conflict produced “the nation” as contestants tried to claim true American nationality and the legacy of the Revolution.”<sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup>
