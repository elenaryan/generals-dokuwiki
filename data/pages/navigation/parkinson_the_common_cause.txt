====Parkinson, The Common Cause: Creating Race and Nation in the American Revolution====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question: ** Why did the colonists unite in war against Britain? What motives and common reasons bound Anglo-Americans to the patriot cause after war broke out?\\ \\

“when these Revolutionary representations mixed with long-standing cultural prejudices about the inferiority of Indians and blacks, it poured American conceptions about who they were at the founding – and who they were not – into new, durable, national vessels.”((Parkinson, 323))\\ \\

This racial common cause did not die when the war ended, but had major implications for who, at the founding, could access citizenship -- who the polity was //for//. \\ \\

It is interesting to think of the story that Parkinson tells as a broadly partisan battle in which the patriots/Whigs attempt to claim that they are the good guys. The real Brits.
