====Morgan, American Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question:** How (and why) could a people have developed the dedication to human liberty and dignity upon which the Revolution was premised while simultaneously maintaining “a system of labor that denied human liberty and dignity every hour of the day”?

To Morgan, the development of racial slavery did not merely pay for American independence, it justified, supported, and enabled the very ideological and material success of Virginia's society during the colonial period.\\
Key turning points:
  * The tobacco boom of the 1620s
  * The tobacco dip of the 1660s
  * Bacon's Rebellion in 1675-76
\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
People remain in conversation with Morgan as they try to come to terms with the fundamental contradiction of American history -- the coexistence of slavery (its very flourishing) alongside an ideology and deep commitment to freedom.
