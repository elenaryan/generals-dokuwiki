<strong>Question:</strong> What did the Revolution mean to women? Why were they not included in the promises of the American Revolution?
<br/>

Kerber gives the answer to this question by coining a term: Republican Motherhood. In doing so, she jumpstarts a whole river of scholarship that has taken to her term that describes both the possibilities and limits of the woman&#039;s participation in the young United States.<br/>

-	Seems like her argument is that women chiseled out space for themselves in the young republic in order to participate in politics as shapers of their sons

Kerber looks at sources of culture â€“ first she does work in intellectual history tracing ideas about women in the Enlightenment. She also looks at Broadsides, the diaries and correspondences of women, and cultural materials like novels. She&#039;s also in the legal limits of women&#039;s participation in politics.
