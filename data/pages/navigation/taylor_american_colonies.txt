====Taylor, American Colonies: The Settling of North America====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
In //American Colonies//, Taylor provides a synthesis from literally 13,000B.C. to 1820. Which is as ambitious as it is chuckle-worthy. In any case, he seems to have done so quite well. His main concern is to provide a continental history viewed broadly -- one that considers the imperial powers as they landed in the Americas and bumped up against one another and the Indigenous inhabitants of the continent.
\\ \\
This isn't a comparative history so much as it's a history of the continent that occasionally invites comparison between European empires.
\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
This is really **the** book on the Americas during the colonial period -- and before. Taylor shows convincingly the progression of colonization in the Americas and gives room to what he sees as a few newer trends: environmental history, Atlantic lens, and Indigenous studies. (Dare I say that the Atlantic lens is growing a bit tired these days.)
\\
=== Sources and Methodology: === 
Synthetic. Sources tend to be "other people's scholarship."
\\
=== Critiques: === 
The environmental bit feels a little shoe-horned in at moments. Also, I think Blackhawk does a MUCH better job of the Great Basin than Taylor. This is fine and to be expected. But it is worth noting that Blackhawk paints what I believe to be a more accurate portrait of the cycles of violence in the North American Southwest during the colonial period.
