====Isenberg, Second Thoughts on Gender and Women's History====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
In her own words, Isenberg reviews "Scott's definition of gender, focusing on its strengths, possible pitfalls, and omissions."((Isenberg, 93))

Isenberg is a bit all over the place, in my opinion. She bristles at the critiques Scott levels at women's history: that gender has not been treated as an analytical category and also Scott's suggestion that women's history will be marginalized until "efforts are made to place gender at the center of... political history." 



\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
This is a pretty polemical view. Isenberg believes that women's history ought not change to suit the "right" kind of history -- political history -- but that the culture must change. And, indeed, she insists that Joan Scott's proposition's "undeveloped critical edge allowed it to be subsumed into traditional descriptive histories."((Isenberg, 101))
