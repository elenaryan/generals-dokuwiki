====Brown, Good Wives, Nasty Wenches, & Anxious Patriarchs: Gender, Race, and Power in Colonial Virginia====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question:** How and why did gender and race become intertwined components of the social order in colonial VA?\\
Early colonial gender is tied closely to labor, a good woman is one who works domestically. Brute labor is what “nasty wenches” do.\\

“The project of defining English families as Christian and white and privileging white patriarchs was intimately connected to the legal denial of English-style families to the enslaved.”((Brown, 136))
\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
This is pretty much as close as we get to intersectionality. Here, Brown departs from the women's histories that preceded her to suggest that //gender// helped to create race and indeed that Black men were feminized and Black women were not allowed to be women, really at all.
\\
=== Sources and Methodology: === 
Intersectionality, some legal approaches
