====Gordon, J. Willard Hurst and the Common Law Tradition in American Legal Historiography====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
Here is something of a precursor to [[navigation:gordon_critical_legal_histories|Gordon, Critical Legal Histories]]. In introducing J. Willard Hurst's contributions to the field of legal history, Gordon articulate its development originating in the 19th century. In doing so, he describes the early practice of //internal// legal history -- that which was only concerned with the actual law, rather than the outside of that. This approach creates for us **the common law tradition** which is to say “the fictional continuity that each generation of common lawyers imposes, in its own fashion and for its own ends, on the development of judicial doctrine.”((Gordon, 17)) \\
\\
Much early legal history followed this tradition and, though there was a brief stint of something like historicizing law to places and times from 1920s-60s, it did not really stick until Hurst showed up to focus on the actual ways "workaday people" would have experienced the law. To Hurst, says Gordon, the task of legal historian “is to measure the actual past performance of government against this potential.”((Gordon, 48))

\\
“Hurst’s main contribution has been to expose the hitherto invisible ways in which the apparently most commonplace incidents of a legal order illuminate social values”((Gordon, 54))
