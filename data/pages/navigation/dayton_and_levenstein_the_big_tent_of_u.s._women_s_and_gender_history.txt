====Dayton and Levenstein, The Big Tent of Women's and Gender History: A State of the Field====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
This is pure historiography. Put differently, this article describes where the field of women's and gender history has been and where it's going. Dayton and Levenstein identify some newish trends and the work that is driving the field.
\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
This paper is helpful for articulating some of the more recent developments in women's and gender history:
  * Intersections of race, gender, and class
  * relational differences among women of various statuses
  * the mutual construction of sexual and gender norms
  * the conceptual destabilizing of gender and sex

It also identifies where historians are doing rewritings -- often in multiple categories at once:
  * The rights revolution (Welke, Pascoe, Edwards, Zagarri)
  * Activism and Social Movements (Feimster, McGuire, Catherine Ramirez, Maylei Blackwell)
  * Emergence of the Modern State (Barr, Canaday, McCurry, Faust)
  * Imperialism and Diplomacy (much in the category above)
  * Politics of Reproduction (like Klepp)
