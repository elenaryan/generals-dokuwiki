=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question: ** What were the abolitionists up against? His key contentions are that the actions of enslaved people contributed significantly to the progress of antislavery sentiment, but that the problem of slavery lay both in rhetoric as well as in who had the power -- be it military, economic, political.\\ 
\\
Importantly, David Brion Davis believes that abolition was inextricably bound up with free labor and the rise of capitalism.
