====Warren, New England Bound: Slavery and Colonization in Early New England====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question: **Why did slavery exist in New England? And what was it like?\\
Warren compellingly shows that the answer to this question is intimately tied to English sugar colonies -- Barbados and Jamaica. New England serves as the farming land that feeds and maintains the sugar colonies. African slave-holding is much smaller scale there than in the sugar colonies and perhaps less brutal but far more isolated.\\

=== Contribution to the Field: === 

\\
=== Sources and Methodology: === 
While Warren is deeply grounded in imperial records, she does not shy away from some fabulation. In doing so, she makes one of her major themes the distinctive experience of enslaved people in early New England.
