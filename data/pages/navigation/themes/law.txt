==== LAW ====

Of course, nearly every author formulates law at least a little differently. Nonetheless, there are a few helpful and identifiable divisions in the literature.

=== Predictive Theory of Law ===

Oliver Wendell Holmes jr. describes this theory of law in [[navigation:holmes_the_path_of_law|Holmes, The Path of the Law]] in which he says that â€œthe primary rights and duties with which jurisprudence busies itself again are nothing but prophecies."


=== Things That I Don't Have Words For ===

Thompson and Holmes agree in opposition to a few legal fictions -- that the law does not have some sort of necessary logic imbued in it.
