====Breen, "Baubles of Britain": The American and Consumer Revolutions of the Eighteenth Century====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question:** How did Americans develop a sense of political purpose such that they succeeded in uniting against England? \\ 

18th c Americans communicated perceptions of status and politics to other people through items of everyday material culture, through a symbolic universe of commonplace “things.”((Breen, 75))\\ 

The shared experience among all colonists, says Breen, is that they are all consumers

\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
This is a super essential article because it is a bit of a counter to both Lemisch and Bailyn's stories. Breen offers a highly materialist argument for shared experience between common colonists -- even women and other sorts -- that unites them to an anti-Britain cause across class lines and without needing education.
