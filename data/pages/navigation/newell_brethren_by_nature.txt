=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
**Question:** What did Indian slavery in New England look like?\\

Newell is communicating two key facts:\\
  * slavery flourished in New England
  * Native Americans formed a significant portion of the enslaved population

She also calls Indians "the charter generation."((Newell, 238))
\\
=== Contribution to the Field: === 
This is really understudied -- the story of Indian slavery. She also moves Indian slavery (and early abolition) a bit earlier to make this a distinctly 17th c story.
