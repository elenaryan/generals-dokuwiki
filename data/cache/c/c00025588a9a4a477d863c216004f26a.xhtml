Foucault writes against the idea that the history of sexuality has been a history of repression. Indeed, in his own words, “The question I would like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? But rather, Why do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment against our most recent past, against our present, and against ourselves, that we are repressed? What led us to show, <strong>ostentatiously</strong>, that sex is something we hide, to say it is something we silence?”<sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup> The idea of repression is closely tied to the idea that power in society primarily operates through repression: censorship, prohibition, denial.<br/>
<br/>

<p>
Rather, Foucault argues, the supposed rise of repression brought the rise of a “Secret Life” – a new discourse – that emerged to govern and police not only appropriate topics of conversation and modes of expression, but also a person&#039;s very desires (as we see in confession).
