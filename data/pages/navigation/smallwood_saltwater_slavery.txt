====Smallwood, Saltwater Slavery: A Middle Passage from Africa to American Diaspora====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
Saltwater Slavery intends to contextualize and subjectivize the slaves who were reduced to numbers during the Middle Passage and by the logs and ledgers that defined society.
\\ \\
This saltwater dimension is both a theater for loss of agency and subjugation and a residual point of significance for diaspora communities, memory, and their own experience of the captive/commodity/slavery transition and prison, really.((Smallwood, 7))
=== Contribution to the Field: === 

\\
=== Sources and Methodology: === 
Method\\
o	Examining ledgers/logs + bringing to life the voyage\\
o	Does not intend the number of enslaved people from a given place or region to dictate a hierarchy of relevance – already fighting the numbers that each person was formerly relegated to\\
o	Uses West African and British American records – esp Royal African Company\\
o	Quantitative and textual (ledgers, bills of lading, accounting) (internal correspondence for day to day picture)\\
