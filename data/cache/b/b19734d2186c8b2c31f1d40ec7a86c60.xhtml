Kerber is really charting the historiography of the concept of “separate spheres” wherein women were thought to have existed in something of a private, household, domestic sphere in opposition to the public, political male sphere. Coined by Tocqueville and pioneered in the 60s, the concept remains durable for a few reasons, as demonstrated in the third evolutionary stage of the metaphor:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Late 1960s and early 70s historians make effort to identify “separate spheres” as central to antebellum women’s historical experience<sup><a href="#fn__1" id="fnt__1" class="fn_top">1)</a></sup></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Prior to 1980, historians make an effort to refine the def of “separate spheres” and identify complexities, introduce “a liberating possibility’ of a woman’s culture</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> After at 1980 forum on the concept and its problems of usage for women’s sphere/culture, historians have sought to embed women’s experience in “the main course of human development” and unpack the spheres metaphor</div>
<ul>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> marked by application to all stages of human life (not just antebellum)</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> also marked by more attention to qs about the social relations of the sexes and treating the language of separate spheres as a historical, rhetorical construction one that responded to changing social and economic reality</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Historians are beginning to use “sphere” literally to explore gendered spaces<sup><a href="#fn__2" id="fnt__2" class="fn_top">2)</a></sup><br/>
<br/>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Kerber wraps up with a gesture to the (fatal) flaws imbued in separate spheres:
“To continue to use the language of separate spheres is to deny the reciprocity between gender and society, and to impose a static model on dynamic relationships.”<sup><a href="#fn__3" id="fnt__3" class="fn_top">3)</a></sup> <br/>
<br/>

“One day we will understand the idea of separate spheres as primarily a trope [employed in the past to describe power relations which they could neither acknowledge nor name] and in the present (the 80s) as a device to dispel the confusion of the anecdote and impose narrative and analytical order on the anarchy of inherited evidence, the better to comprehend the world in which we live.”<sup><a href="#fn__4" id="fnt__4" class="fn_top">4)</a></sup>

It seems this was something of a death knell for separate spheres – a sort of attentiveness in the field of woman&#039;s history to the kind of shift Joan Scott is calling for.
