====Kerber, Separate Spheres, Female Worlds, Woman's Place: The Rhetoric of Women's History====
=== Animating Questions/Argument: === 
Kerber is really charting the historiography of the concept of "separate spheres" wherein women were thought to have existed in something of a private, household, domestic sphere in opposition to the public, political male sphere. Coined by Tocqueville and pioneered in the 60s, the concept remains durable for a few reasons, as demonstrated in the third evolutionary stage of the metaphor:
  * Late 1960s and early 70s historians make effort to identify “separate spheres” as central to antebellum women’s historical experience((Kerber, 17))
  * Prior to 1980, historians make an effort to refine the def of “separate spheres” and identify complexities, introduce “a liberating possibility’ of a woman’s culture
  * After at 1980 forum on the concept and its problems of usage for women’s sphere/culture, historians have sought to embed women’s experience in “the main course of human development” and unpack the spheres metaphor
      * marked by application to all stages of human life (not just antebellum)
      * also marked by more attention to qs about the social relations of the sexes and treating the language of separate spheres as a historical, rhetorical construction one that responded to changing social and economic reality
      * Historians are beginning to use “sphere” literally to explore gendered spaces((Kerber, 31))\\ \\

Kerber wraps up with a gesture to the (fatal) flaws imbued in separate spheres:
"To continue to use the language of separate spheres is to deny the reciprocity between gender and society, and to impose a static model on dynamic relationships."((Kerber, 39)) \\ \\
“One day we will understand the idea of separate spheres as primarily a trope [employed in the past to describe power relations which they could neither acknowledge nor name] and in the present (the 80s) as a device to dispel the confusion of the anecdote and impose narrative and analytical order on the anarchy of inherited evidence, the better to comprehend the world in which we live.”((Kerber, 39))

=== Contribution to the Field: === 
It seems this was something of a death knell for separate spheres -- a sort of attentiveness in the field of woman's history to the kind of shift Joan Scott is calling for.
